 ## What is NetWave?
Netwave is a client / server application developed as a university project. It has been full developed using Java, and includes a little GUI made with Swing.

It allows the simultaneous streaming of music without downloading, using TCP sockets. If you love music and you want to dowload music while you are at home, NetWave is your solution.

You could make your own music server.

## How to use it
To be able to test it on localhost, create a folder called "Canciones", at the same level as the project 
(you can create it wherever you want, but you must modify the code). Once you run the server, several clients 
can access the songs via a graphical interface.

## Contact
Thanks for the visit, I hope you enjoy the Netwave service.
If you have any questions, contact me through this platform.

Sincerely, Luis Cabezon.
