Streaming music via sockets TCP
 
Netwave is a client / server application developed as a university project.
It allows the simultaneous streaming of music without downloading, using TCP sockets.

To be able to test it on localhost, create a folder called "Canciones", at the same level as the project 
(you can create it wherever you want, but you must modify the code). Once you run the server, several clients 
can access the songs via a graphical interface.

Thanks for the visit, I hope you enjoy the Netwave service.
If you have any questions, contact me through this platform.

Sincerely, Luis Cabezon.
